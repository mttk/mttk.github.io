I'm a teaching assistant at the <a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/artint" title="AI course" rel="permalink">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/deelea" title="Deep learning" rel="permalink">Deep Learning</a> courses (2016-present) and occasionally at the <a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar" title="Text analysis & retrieval" rel="permalink">Text Analysis and Retrieval</a> course.

Apart from lab assignments, I teach lectures on reinforcement learning (AI), recurrent neural networks (DL) and distributed representations of words (TAR).
