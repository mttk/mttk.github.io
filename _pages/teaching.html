I'm a teaching assistant at the [Artificial Intelligence](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/artint) and [Deep Learning](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/deelea) courses (2016-present) and occasionally at the [Text Analysis and Retrieval](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar) course.

Apart from lab assignments, I teach lectures on reinforcement learning (AI), recurrent neural networks (DL) and distributed representations of words (TAR).
