I'm a teaching assistant at the <a href = "http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/artint">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href = "http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/deelea">Deep Learning</a> courses (2016-present) and occasionally at the <a href = "http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar">Text Analysis and Retrieval</a> course.

Apart from lab assignments, I teach lectures on reinforcement learning (AI), recurrent neural networks (DL) and distributed representations of words (TAR).
