I'm a postdoc at Technion working with [Yonatan Belinkov](https://belinkov.com/). My research interests within natural language processing are interpretability, efficiency of prompting LLMs, LLM distillation and enforcing safety and faithfulness of (LLM-)generated texts.

Previously, I did a postdoc at the [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt working on the [InterText](https://intertext.ukp-lab.de/) initiative, while I obtained my PhD at the University of Zagreb under supervision of [Jan Å najder](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~jan/).
