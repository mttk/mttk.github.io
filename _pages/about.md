I'm a fifth year PhD student in NLP at the [Text Analysis and Knowledge Engineering Lab](http://takelab.fer.hr/) at the University of Zagreb, supervised by [Jan Å najder](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~jan/).

I'm interested in controllability of NLP models. The path to controllability leads through sparse and interpretable models where I've done most work so far. I dislike the current one (sub)word - one vector paradigm and believe the way forward is through shared word representations.
