I'm a fourth year PhD student in NLP at the [Text Analysis and Knowledge Engineering Lab](http://takelab.fer.hr/) at the University of Zagreb, supervised by [Jan Å najder](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~jan/).

My interests lie in the intersection of sparsity and interpretability. I'm motivated by work of Arora et al (1.) which demonstrates that a set of core meaning representations (linguistic atoms) can be learned from an embedding matrix. Through sharing of these representations, models can become interpretable among other benefits. I'm interested in making the learning process online and apt for modern NLP systems. Apart from that, I'm interested in interpretability of modern NLP models and to which extent is a model being interepretable a valid bias in model selection.

I'm also very interested in traffic flow optimization.
