I'm a postdoc at Technion working with [Yonatan Belinkov](https://belinkov.com/). My research interests within natural language processing are interpretability, efficiency of prompting LLMs, LLM distillation and enforcing safety and faithfulness of (LLM-)generated texts.

Previously, I did a postdoc at the [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt working on the [InterText](https://intertext.ukp-lab.de/) initiative, while I obtained my PhD at the University of Zagreb under supervision of [Jan Å najder](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~jan/). Before my PhD I worked at the European Commision's [Joint Research Centre](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/joint-research-centre_en) in Ispra on using NLP to update the the [Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030](https://www.undrr.org/publication/sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-2015-2030). Our efforts were credited in UNISDR's group report [Science is used for Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.unisdr.org/files/42848_stag2015.pdf).
