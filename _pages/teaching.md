In the summer semester of 2025, I will be substituting Jan Å najder at the University of Zagreb's [Introduction to AI](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/itai) course.

During my postdoc at the UKP Lab of TU Darmstadt, I wrote and held lectures for the second half of the [20-00-0947: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/dl4nlp-tuda/deep-learning-for-nlp-lectures/) course. Lecture slides and recordings are available at the git repository.

During my PhD at the University of Zagreb, from 2016--2022 I wrote and held lectures, as well as designed lab assignments for the [Introduction to AI](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/itai), [Deep Learning](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/dubuce1) and [Text Analysis and Retrieval](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar).
Lectures from the Deep Learning course are available (albeit in Croatian) on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mtutek).
